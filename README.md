# VSPlugins
Plugins for communicating with National Instruments board using NIDAQmx. Plugins are in C++, and imported into Unity.
Something important is being excluded from git repository, which causes problems with interaction with NIDAQmx library. 
Haven't figured this out yet. For now, for initial setting up, have to copy entire directory with usb stick, and then
updating wtih git works fine. Meh.
